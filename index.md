### Welcome to my GitHub user page.
I'm Andrew Hills and I'm currently based in Sheffield, UK. I am a research fellow at the [Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse/) at the [University of Sheffield](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk).

My research interests are signal processing, machine learning, data mining and fault detection. When I'm not researching, I enjoy music, piano playing, photography, walking/hiking, food and reading. I'd love to do more travelling.

## GitHub repositories
I have a number of GitHub repositories in a number of languages including:

* [PythonUtils](http://ahills60.github.io/PythonUtils)
